# Machine Learning Fundamentals for Programmers

This course will teach participants the fundamental building blocks of statistical learning needed to see opportunities in real-life data and pick techniques that can be shipped in product today. It is designed for those who have no background in machine learning or statistics, but a love for hacking.

Attendees are expected to have a background in programming and basic working knowledge of at least one language with basic statistical libraries (Python, R, Julia, Java/Scala/Clojure, Matlab/Octave, Go). Days will consist of morning lectures focused on building theoretical knowledge, followed by open-ended exercises in the afternoon, completed in any language/framework of the students' preference, designed to demystify the theory and show the underlying hackability of these ideas.

Everyone is encouraged to bring data, ideas, products, and problems to work on specifically and will start on a personal project on the last day that can be continued after the course, professionally or personally.
