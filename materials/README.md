### Raining in Barcelona

Let's say you've been to Barcelona for 5 days, out of which it rained 2. Your job is to forecast whether or not it will rain on the 6th day.

A natural choice is "no". 40% of the days you saw were rainy, so you guess "no". What else would you want to communicate to someone? What more would be communicated if you said "40%" vs "no" (base errror rate of the problem).

40% would be the base error rate IF we had infinite data of days and no other information at our disposal. How do we quanitify the difference between having 5 days of data and infinite? Let's come up with some reasonable ideas...

### Necessary to understand errors, bias, variance:

* Variance
* Mean/Median
* Probability Density Function + Mode

### ROC Curves

Use these in context of base error rates, approximation vs estimation error.

### Random
* [LowRankModels](https://github.com/madeleineudell/LowRankModels.jl)
* [tensorflow.js?](https://github.com/malmaud/TensorFlow.jl) (look at log reg example!)
