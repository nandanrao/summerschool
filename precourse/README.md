# Pre-Course

## Math + Probability

### [Data Science Math Skills](https://www.coursera.org/learn/datasciencemathskills) :: 8 hours

This course introduces a number of important concepts with very intuitive explanations that assume no background knowledge in any of the maths. You should be very comfortable with all of the ideas presented in this course.


### [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) :: 24 hours

This book provides an extremely concise and focused introduction to the linear algebra and probability needed for us to discuss the core concepts of Data Science. It is dense for those without a maths background, so please devote the time to spend with the material to make sure you understand it on a level of intuition and strong familiarity.

* Chapter 2: Linear Algebra
* Chapter 3: Probability and Information Theory


## Programming :: 0-8 hours

If your experience consists primarily of languages that do not have a good machine learning ecosystem or are not suited towards interactive computing and plotting, we recommend learning Python through the following courses, only 8 hours in total:

* Datacamp Intro to Python for Data Science
* Datacamp Intermediate Python for Data Science

If you already have deep experience with one of the following languages and would prefer to stick to it, here are the libraries and frameworks we recommend familiarizing yourself with:

### Python

* Scikit Learn
* Numpy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

### R

* Tidyverse (ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr)
* Caret

### Julia

* Scikitlearn.jl

### Scala/Java

* Smile

### JS

* ml.js
