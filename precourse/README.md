If your experience consists primarily of languages that do not have a good machine learning ecosystem or are not suited towards interactive computing and plotting, we recommend learning Python through the following courses, only 8 hours in total:

* Datacamp Intro to Python for Data Science
* Datacamp Intermediate Python for Data Science

If you already have deep experience with one of the following languages and would prefer to stick to it, here are the libraries and frameworks we recommend familiarizing yourself with:

### Python

* Scikit Learn
* Numpy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

### R

* Tidyverse (ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr)
* Caret

### Julia

* Scikitlearn.jl

### Scala/Java

* Smile

### JS
