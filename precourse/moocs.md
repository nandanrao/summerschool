## Notes on MOOC's:


### Coursera/Duke: Intro to Probability and Data

* Exploring Numerical Data: mean/median/skew/robustness/montonic transforms /
* Categorical Data: stupid bar plots, useless
* Inference: brings in null hyp, dumb.

### Zurich - Introduction to Probability

* arbitrary distinctions aren't interesting

### Bayesian

* Starts off already confusing. Stupid

### Math Skills for Data Science
This is the best.

* Sets

* Real number line is kinda basic...

* Summation seems kinda basic except mean/variance, which is quite nicely explained and notation introduced.

* week 2 - plotting is really simple - distance important?
* week 2 - functions is ok, from set to set
